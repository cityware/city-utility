     * We do an intial UDP port scan high in the port range. We're
     * doing this to minimize the detection of legitimate open ports so
     * that we can get an estimate of the number of UDP packets that are
     * being lost due to the network connection. We'll use this estimate
     * of lost packets to figure the number of cleanupIterations we'll need
     * to run. The formula to determine this is similar to one used to
     * calculate exponential rate of decay.
     *
     * From the UDP packets that don't timeout, we also establish
     * the standard deviation of how long it took them to completete the
     * round trip. This is used to setup a timeout value of 4 sigma from
     * the average round trip time for the socket_set_timeout function.
     * Because the socket_set_timeout currently won't except a value of
     * less than a second this is mainly an exercise in futility in terms
     * of minimizing program run time. If the socket_set_timeout function
     * is ever changed to allow a value of less than one second, then
     * under good network conditions we could expect a decrease in runtime
     * of up to a factor of five.
